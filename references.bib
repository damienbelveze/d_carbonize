We categorized types of DAS. We surveyed corresponding authors who wrote in DAS that they would share the data. A consent to participate in the study was sought for all included manuscripts. After accessing raw data sets, we checked whether data were available in a way that enabled re-analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Of 3556 analyzed articles, 3416 contained DAS. The most frequent DAS category (42\%) indicated that the datasets are available on reasonable request. Among 1792 manuscripts in which DAS indicated that authors are willing to share their data, 1670 (93\%) authors either did not respond or declined to share their data with us. Among 254 (14\%) of 1792 authors who responded to our query for data sharing, only 122 (6.8\%) provided the requested data.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Even when authors indicate in their manuscript that they will share data upon request, the compliance rate is the same as for authors who do not provide DAS, suggesting that DAS may not be sufficient to ensure data sharing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in neuroimaging research and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.}
