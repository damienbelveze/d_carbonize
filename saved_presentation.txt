title: "Implementing FAIR and Responsible Data Management: The Importance of a Data & Software Management Plan for Your Research Project"
abstract: "According to the open-source paradigm, research data collected by researchers should be made as open as possible and as closed as necessary. FAIR standards were designed to help scholars achieve this goal.Our presentation aims to explain how these standards can be met during a research project and why their implementation should be anticipated in the initial draft of a data management plan. In our scope, we will include the management of research source code, which is necessary to process this data."

1. three pillars of Open Science

2. FAIR applied to data

3. FAIR applied to software (as much as possible)

# data and software management plans

- information required by funding bodies (ANR, OpenAire)
- first draft must be transmitted no later than 6 months after contract is signed
- template available on [DMP OPIDOR](https://dmp.opidor.fr/)
- Contact ARDoISE data hub (through DMP OPIDOR or direct mail to [guichet-ardoise@groupes.renater.fr](mailto:https://groupes.renater.fr/sympa/info/guichet-ardoise))

no reproductibility = no public trust in Science

first step: your paper must provide a DAS (Data availibily statement)

# Speaking about repositories

:::{.incremental}
- avoid commercial ones
- check licence and policy
- curated by someone ?
- located in Europe (GDPR) ?

:::{.notes}

- Is the repository future-proof? : the chosen repository should have been online for at least 5 years.

- **Does the repository's policy restricts the choice of licences that can assigned to your data? : if you cannot share your data under the licence you have chosen, you would better find a better offer elsewhere.**

- **Are deposits curated by someone? Without a proper curation, your may neglect important metadata in your dataset's description which could have a negative impact on its findability and reusability.**

- Do you have to pay to deposit your data? Some fees are abusive, particularly in the for-profit sector, where some big companies charge costs that bear no relation to the service provided

- **Is the repository located in Europe? GDPR compliance is at stake**

# As open as possible as closed as necessary

Openness may be limited by:

- GDPR (personal data involved)
- consortium agreement: 
   * industrial interest
   * intellectual property (id data are of intellectural nature : photographs, texts)

# Access to data: play by the rules

- A DAS cannot contain: Data not available

- if Available Upon Request (AUR): somebody has to answer the request
