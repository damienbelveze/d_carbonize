title: "Implementing FAIR and Responsible Data Management: The Importance of a Data & Software Management Plan for Your Research Project"
abstract: "According to the open-source paradigm, research data collected by researchers should be made as open as possible and as closed as necessary. FAIR standards were designed to help scholars achieve this goal.Our presentation aims to explain how these standards can be met during a research project and why their implementation should be anticipated in the initial draft of a data management plan. In our scope, we will include the management of research source code, which is necessary to process this data."

1. three pillars of Open Science

2. FAIR applied to data

3. FAIR applied to software (as much as possible)

:::
:::
::::

:::{.notes}
FAIR was originally applied to data (>2016). at the beginning, researchers thought difficult to apply these concepts to research software, because software evolves in time and receives continuous improvements, while datasets remain unchanged after publication ; but the community led by FAIR4RS organisation showed that there more benefits than drawbacks to use FAIR for research software. See for instance :notebook: @barkerIntroducingFAIRPrinciples2022

# data and software management plans

- information required by funding bodies (ANR, OpenAire)
- first draft must be sent to the funder no later than 6 months after contract is signed
- template available on [DMP OPIDOR](https://dmp.opidor.fr/)
- Contact ARDoISE data hub (through DMP OPIDOR or direct mail to [guichet-ardoise@groupes.renater.fr](mailto:https://groupes.renater.fr/sympa/info/guichet-ardoise))

no reproductibility = no public trust in Science

first step: your paper must provide a DAS (Data availabily statement)

:::

:::{.notes}
what are articles published without their data if not jockeys riding invisible horses?

LancetGate: may be you remember the LancetGate when in the peak dot the COVID outbreak the prestigious journal The Lancet had to retract an article that they published because it had been reviewed without the data, and when researchers outside the editorial board asked for the data, nor the Journal neither the authors themselves coud provide, as if they had been forged (we'll never know)?

## Findability in FAIR principles

FAIR principles :notebook: @gorgolewskiPracticalGuideImproving2016

![](images/FAIR1.png){#fig-fair fig-alt="This image represents the principles of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data framework. The image is organized into four columns, each corresponding to one of the four FAIR principles, with icons and text boxes representing specific requirements under each principle. Here's a breakdown:
Findable (leftmost column, black background):
A magnifying glass icon represents the ability to search and find data.
Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) with an ID card symbol.
Rich metadata with a stack of papers icon.
Indexed data repositories shown as a database icon.
PIDs in metadata with an ID card symbol and document.
Accessible (second column, dark purple background):
A finger pressing a button icon, representing accessibility.
Standard communications protocol with a network diagram.
Open, free protocol with connected nodes and dollar signs indicating cost-free access.
Authentication, where necessary showing an ID badge icon.
Metadata is always available with an infinity loop symbol.
Interoperable (third column, dark red background):
A gear icon representing interoperability.
Vocabularies with a flowchart symbol of interconnected boxes.
Vocabularies are FAIR with an icon of interconnected FAIR-compliant resources.
Linked metadata symbolized by connected documents with metadata symbols.
Reusable (rightmost column, blue/yellow/green background):
A recycling icon symbolizing reusability.
Metadata have multiple attributes with a document stack icon.
Usage license represented by an open padlock and checkmark.
Provenance with a flowchart indicating tracking data origins.
Community standards with a symbol of a community gathered around a standard board.
This visual emphasizes the specific aspects of data management that adhere to the FAIR principles, ensuring data is optimally used and shared across systems and communities."}


# Speaking about repositories

:::{.incremental}
- avoid commercial ones
- check licence and policy
- curated by someone ?
- located in Europe (GDPR) ?
:::
[COSO guide](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/research-data-how-to-choose-a-repository/)

[recherche data gouv](https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataverse/univ-rennes)

:::{.notes}

- Is the repository future-proof? : the chosen repository should have been online for at least 5 years.

- **Does the repository's policy restricts the choice of licences that can assigned to your data? : if you cannot share your data under the licence you have chosen, you would better find a better offer elsewhere.** For instance Dryad makes compulsory the use of CC0 to datasets, which is not aligned with French author rights.

- **Are deposits curated by someone? Without a proper curation, your may neglect important metadata in your dataset's description which could have a negative impact on its findability and reusability.**

- Do you have to pay to deposit your data? Some fees are abusive, particularly in the for-profit sector, where some big companies charge costs that bear no relation to the service provided

- **Is the repository located in Europe? GDPR compliance is at stake**

Openness may be limited by:

- GDPR (personal data involved)
- consortium agreement: 
   * industrial interest
   * intellectual property (id data are of intellectural nature : photographs, texts)

## Access to data: play by the rules

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{.incremental}

- A DAS cannot contain: "Data not available" :angry:

- if Available Upon Request (AUR): somebody has to answer the request

-  n=3416 : no answer or negative answer without any justification :notebook: (@gabelicaManyResearchersWere2022a)
:::
:::{.notes}
a 2022 study of 3416 articles with a DAS showed that in 93% of cases, authors did not respond to requests or responded negatively without justification

Outside the openness of the data as set by the authors, Accessibility is considered as a rather straightforward condition to implement, but actullay it's not : think of connectivity issues for researchers in developing countries, how to adress the probleme of lack of bandwidth for "the last kilometer" (see for instance :notebook: @shanahanRethinkingFAIRData2022a )

@brownFixingScienceMeans2024a : A DAS in itself is not enough, what counts is the accessibility of data whenever it's possible

- cf. RDM scary tale ([costly birthdays](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/stories/articles/counter-eng.html)) 
- choose non proprietary software (forget Microsoft)
- use transparent tools (R is a good option)

:::
::::

:::{.notes}
In R, every data manipulation is traceable (codeline) ; an unexpected conversion can simply not occur. Provided the packages versions used are still available, anything can be replicated from the beginning.

## provide an open and standard licence

:::{.incremental}
- FR: 2 options are recommended = ODBL / Etalab
- you have the **authorship** but not the **ownership** of the data
- you must be credited (CC:by 4.0 is also possible)
- But, access limitations are regulated (it's not up to you)
:::

:::{.notes}
first and foremost a matter of what researchers will entitled to do with your data, a matter of licence which must be clear and standard.

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{.incremental}
- scientific integrity debates focus on data sharing practices, not enough on source code replicability

- while data sharing practices are becoming standards, not enough incentive to share source code are provided :notebook: @jean-quartierSharingPracticesSoftware2024a

- only a few publishers ask reviewers to replicate source code (NeurIPS)
:::
:::
::::

:::{.notes}
progress in computing sciences, because source code plays the role of methodology 
but no substantial improvements in other fields of knowledge
:::


## Archive and make visible

![](images/code_source_executable.png){#fig-executable fig-alt="three screenshots explaining the differences between 1. binaries files 2. source code and 3. executable files"}

- **source code** (not algorithm or binaries/executable)
- A forge is not an archive (**forges disappear sometimes** - i.e Bitbucket in 2020)

:::{.notes}
Program must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute (Harold Abelson, 1985). Most of the times, compilers are not reproducible enough.

## code replicability

save not only the source code files but also:

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
the software stack within virtual environments (venv/Renv)
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
the runtime and other Operating system settings through (Docker) images :notebook: @ziemannFivePillarsComputational2023
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
Use Guix as package manager to improve replicability :notebook: @gorgolewskiPracticalGuideImproving2016
